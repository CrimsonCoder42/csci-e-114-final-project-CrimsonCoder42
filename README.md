# Project Requirements

To meet the project requirements, please ensure the following:

1. **Static Site Generator**: Make sure that the pages in your project are built using a Static Site Generator. Next.js already supports static site generation, and current code utilizes the `getStaticProps` and `getStaticPaths` functions to pre-render pages at build time. Project meets this requirement.

2. **Data-Driven Content**: Your project should utilize data to drive the content. Currently fetching data from the National Park Service API and the Weather API, which fulfills this requirement.

3. **Version Control with GitHub**: Create a repository on GitHub and push your project to it. https://github.com/cscie114/csci-e-114-final-project-CrimsonCoder42/tree/main/final_app
